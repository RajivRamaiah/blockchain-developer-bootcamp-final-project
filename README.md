## Idea 1 - Decentralized Fantasy Football Payment System
Fantasy football is a game that allows you to create a fictional football team that competes against other members of your leage on a weekly basis throughout the duration of the NFL football league. Participating members undergo a draft where they pick a football team, ensuring they have all of the necessary offensive football positionos and a defense. Each week, members are matched up and win their match up if their team scoores more points then the other. Points are scored based ont he performance of that members team players in real gamees that week. 

Peoplee coommonly bet money. Here's how my friends play:
1. Each member must contribute a buy in fee to a "pot" before the season begins. In our case we venmo one person, the commissioner, our buy in fee and he holds onto it for the duration of the NFL season until a winner is crowned. 
2. To prevent laziness (i.e some people don't set their line ups), the person with the lowest poiont tally for a given week must pay an additional fee to the pot, up to three times for any player. If a user has comoes in lastt 4 times and, the person in second place that week will pay the fee, and so on. 


### Problems with todays betting system
1. One central commissioner controls the funds. 
2. Hard to keep track of uniquee rules
