# Final Project Ideas
## Idea 1 - Decentralized Fantasy Football Payment System
Fantasy football is a game that allows you to create a fictional football team that competes against other members of your leage on a weekly basis throughout the duration of the NFL football league. I personally play fantasy football to stay connected with old college friends 

Here's how we play:
1. Each user must contribute a buy in fee to a "pot" before the season begins. In our case, we venmo one person, the commissioner, our buy in fee and he holds onto it for the duration of the game
2. To prevent laziness (i.e some people don't set their line ups), the person with the lowest poiont tally for a giveen week must pay an additional fee to the pot, up to three times. 
3. 

### Problems with todays betting system
1. One central commissioner controls the funds. 
2. Hard to keep track of uniquee rules
